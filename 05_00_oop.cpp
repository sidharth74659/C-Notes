    Modular Programming :
        - contains a set of functions

    Object Oriented Programming :
        - Contains different objects that comes under same class
        - Each object contains functions, and data related to functions

        For Example, A Government can have several objects :
            - Electric, Water, Bank, Education
        And contains functions, and its data for each
            - newConnection(), close(), payBill()
            - setConnection(), checkQuality()
            - deposit(), withdraw()
            - newSchool(), checkStandard(), issueScholarship()

        This approach helps us to work efficiently when building with softwares at large scale,
            as it helps us to treat/look/ mimic the real world objects easily when building them
